# Geojson
An assortment of location data I have created while learning a bit about geojson.
Feel free to use or edit the data for your own projects.
The living unit counts come from a few phones calls I made and mostly from a spreadsheet found at: https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zZWrXropvGmg.khCidF_taDnk
